				Hello! My name is Zaira Denise L. Fernandez, Zaira in short. My close friends and family call me Zai, some call me Zai-zai, and even Zaiden which is a combination of both of my names. I am currently 14 and will turn 15 this February 5. I was born and raised in Tarlac city and just moved here in Davao two years ago. We are 6 in the family, particularly my mama, papa, and 3 brothers. A fun fact about me is that I have a love and hate relationship with computer science. There are many times where I genuinely enjoy creating websites and typing in codes and tags; and at some point in my highschool life, I even considered computer science as my favorite subject. However, sometimes I do wish that computer science was easy and not complicated and frustrating

				I have chosen overpopulation as the issue to be addressed in my website because this social issue has always been evident in our globe for so long and I want to take part in putting an end to it. I hope that through viewing this website that people will become educated about overpopulation and will help share this knowledge to others.
				
				
				<br><br>
				
				
				I aspire to be someone who creates an impact and positive change to society and the planet. I believe that overpopulation is a large issue that needs to be resolved as it extremely hinders progress and is the reason behind several other issues that our country deals with now. I am aware that constructing this website may only be a small step to others; however,  I also believe that microsolutions will eventually lead to macro effects.
