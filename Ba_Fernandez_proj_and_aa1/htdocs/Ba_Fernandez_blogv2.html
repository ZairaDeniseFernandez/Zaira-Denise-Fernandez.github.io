				Overpopulation occurs when the human population grows to a level that exceeds the natural setting's carrying capacity. People may outnumber available vital supplies for survival in an overpopulated environment, such as transportation, water, housing, food, or social facilities. This issue may give birth to several fatal causes such as depletion of resources, increase in the morbidity, mortality, malnutrition, inflation rates and etc.</p>
				
				<br><br>
				
				<p>
				Within last five decades or so, population growth has skyrocketed, ending in overpopulation. Birth and death rates have been able to balance one other in the history of our species, allowing us to maintain a sustainable population growth rate.
				
				<br><br><br>
				
				Overpopulation impacts developing countries more than developed countries, yet it now affects the majority of the planet. When discussing overpopulation, we must first fully comprehend the main causes.</p>

		<h1 style text-align="center">What causes Overpopulation?</h1>
		
		<br><br>

		<div class="causes">
			
			<h1>Declining Mortality Rate</h1>

			<br>
	
			<p>The major and arguably apparent cause of population expansion is the imbalance between births and deaths. Below is a birth vs. death rate chart. Both the birth and death rate are given per 1,000 people of the country's population. Countries which lie above the gray line have a greater birth than death rate, meaning the total population is increasing; those below the line have a declining population.</p>

			<h1>Poverty</h1>
			
			<p>Poverty and overpopulation are linked in a vicious cycle. One factor can lead to the occurrence of another, and vice versa. When child mortality is high (typically as a result of living in poverty), the total birth rate is high as well. Thus, lowering the child mortality rate through reducing poverty should prioritized. The child mortality rate measures the share of children that die before reaching the age of 5.</p>

			<h1>Poor Family Planning</h1>
		
			<br>
		
			<p>A huge percentage of individuals in most developing countries are illiterate, belong to the lowest class, and have little toÂ no awareness about family planning. These individuals are unable to comprehend the negative consequences of overpopulation, and their lack of access to excellent education leads them to overlook family planning.

			<br><br><br><br>
			
			<h1>Immigration</h1>
			
			<p>Many people choose to relocate to developed nations such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, where the leading healthcare, educational, security, and employment opportunities are available. As a result, such individuals migrate to those areas, eventually overcrowding them. When the number of people leaving the nation exceeds the number of persons entering, there is normally a surge in demand for food, clothing, energy, and shelter. This results in a scarcity of resources. Although the overall population remains same, the density of the people increases, making the area overpopulated. In this map, population bubbles are colored according to whether the country has a greater immigrant or emigrant population.</p>
